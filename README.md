## Introduction

The **Facial Expression-Based Lie Detection System** is a socially impactful project that aims to assist interrogators and investigators in determining the likelihood of a person lying or being truthful based on their facial expressions. The system leverages advanced computer vision techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze facial expressions and provide insights to the interrogators.

This project is built with the vision of enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lie detection processes while promoting ethical considerations and the responsible use of technology in sensitive situations.

## Features

- Detects facial expressions associated with lying, such as microexpressions and deviations from baseline behavior.
- Provides real-time feedback to interrogators during interviews or interrogations.
- Offers a user-friendly interface for inputting video streams or images.
- Generates confidence scores to indicate the system's confidence level in the prediction.
- Customizable threshold settings to control the sensitivity of the lie detection.
